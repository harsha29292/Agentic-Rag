  "abstract": "The invention discloses a grid-connected non-networking micro-grid system and a control protection method thereof. On the premise of basically not changing the structure of the original power distribution system, multiple types of distributed power sources, such as wind power generation system, photovoltaic power generation system, cell accumulation system and the like, are connected into a common power grid along with user loads through AC buses, and reasonable load layout and active energy management are utilized to implement grid-connected non-networking of the micro-grid system. By using the structural design and the active energy management of the micro-grid central control unit, the new energy power generation system can be completely self-sufficient, and does not reversely transmit power to the common power grid, thereby avoiding impacting the normal power supply of the common power grid; and meanwhile, by the aid of the common power grid, the user loads have higher power supply reliability and electric power quality.",
