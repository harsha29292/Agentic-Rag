  "abstract": "A power plant uses an energy source (1) to produce electricity in a first generator. The electricity from the first generator provides heat to a solid heat storage medium (2). The solid heat storage medium (2) is a heat exchanger and water is pumped through the solid heat storage medium to receive heat in order to convert the water into steam. The steam is then used to drive a set of second generators (4) to produce electricity. In this way, electricity can be produced using heat from the heat storage medium (2) whether or not the energy source (1) is operable. For example, if the energy source (1) is a wind turbine and the wind is not traveling at sufficient velocity to produce electricity, the heat storage medium can be used to convert water into steam, and reheat steam which is then used to generate electricity in a second generator (4).",
